Backup your save

Backup your save file before adding new mods. I'm very new to modding and I built up this mod from a tutorial mod,
so it's going to be unstable, buggy or even worse.

Features
--------

- Use custom keybindings to command your pets.
- Tell your pets where to go, or your dragons where to hover.
- Command your pets to attack mobs, or your dragons to breath at a specific area.
- Use dragon staff from a distance, cycle the command mode from the ground, no dragon flute is ever needed.
- Use totem of undying to resurrect tamed dragons.

Other stuff
-----------

- Trident hit can make your pets to attack, just like what bows and arrows does. It can also teleport you to the hit
point if you are sneaking.
- A wand that teleport you to anywhere you pointed.
- A simple damage feedback system migrated from https://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=795249
