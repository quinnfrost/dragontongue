Backup your save
--------------------

Backup your save file before adding new mods. I'm very new to modding and I built up this mod from a tutorial mod,
so it's going to be unstable, buggy or even worse.

Features
--------

- Use custom keybindings to command your pets.
- Tell your pets where to go, or your dragons where to hover.
- Command your pets to attack mobs, or your dragons to breath at a specific area.
- Use dragon staff from a distance, cycle the command mode from the ground, no dragon flute is ever needed.
- Use totem of undying to resurrect tamed dragons.

Other stuff
-----------

- Trident hit can make your pets to attack, just like what bows and arrows does. It can also teleport you to the hit
point if you are sneaking.
- A wand that teleport you to anywhere you pointed.
- A simple damage feedback system migrated from https://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=795249

How to use
----------

- Use "Select" key (default to G) to select your pet (like dragons or wolves, horses). While holding the key,
point your crosshair to your pet and use left mouse button to add the pet you pointed to you command list,
click right mouse button will remove it from the list, and remove any command it follows, click both will clear the list.
The middle scroll button can be used to set the command list with only the pet you pointed. Scroll up and down will adjust
the select range.
- Use "Command" key (default to V) to command, holding the command key and click left mouse button will make all the pet
on the command list to attack, if the command list is empty, it will make any tamed pet in the select range to attack the target,
right click will make all pet on the list move to the location crosshair points, specially if the crosshair is pointed to the
sky, the dragons in the command list will try to fly and hold to that position, you can use mouse scroll to adjust the
distance you want the dragons to hover. Click both button will make all the dragon breath to the target position and if
the list is empty the dragons within the select range will breathe. Use middle button to command any tamed pet to stop doing anything.
- Use "Status" key (default to H) to set the state of the pet. Left click will make the pet to follow you (Vanilla behavior),
right click will make the pet sit (Vanilla too), middle button let a dragon wander (Iaf only), same as the dragon staff works.
